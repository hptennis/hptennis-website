title: Hampden Park Club Sessions
---

 The club runs several club sessions every week; these sessions are mixin sessions, primarily doubles where we play nine games and change round (Note: When there are odd numbers attending, we play seven games to reduce wait times). Most sessions are usually busy, quite often filling up all five courts at peak times. 

 **Note: In the Winter months (Sept to March), on Wednesday evening's players are asked to contribute Â£1 towards the running costs and up keep of the lights.**
 
 We also have a dedicated Ladies' session on Tuesday evening and Men's match practice on Sunday morning.

 We have dedicated intermediate sessions on Monday evening for those wanting to improve their game.
