### January 2022. New Floodlights

Our old floodlights have been in place for many years. They are very expensive to maintain and run. Escalating costs and difficulties obtaining the required bulbs has meant looking to upgrade the lights rather than keep repairing them.
Once again Sovereign Sports gave us the most competitive price and were given the job of replacing the lights on courts 4&5.
