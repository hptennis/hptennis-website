### October 2021 New Changing Rooms

We were finally able to go ahead with our building plans in October 2021. Our chosen contractors were a local building contractor, Elmes and Smart. Our old changing rooms were demolished within a few days and work started on the new building.

**No toilets at Hampden Park for 8 weeks!!** Don’t drink too much or you will need a trip to the café or pop behind the bushes.

Our new building is finished. There is plenty of storage, a light bright interior, and access and facilities for people with disabilities. 
We would like to thank our builders Elmes and Smart. They have been a great bunch of people, very helpful and gone the extra mile for us.

We would also like to thank the following people for contributing funding to help us complete this project.

* Sport England
* The John Jackson Trust
* The Hampden Park Ward Council
* The LTA.
