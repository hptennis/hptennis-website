## Hampden Park Tennis Club Improvements

Over the past few years Hampden Park Tennis club has embarked on a program of improvements.
                    
Our priority has always been with our playing surfaces, but it was becoming increasingly clear 
that something needed to be done about our rotting changing rooms. Over the last five years we
have been looking at raising money and getting the relevant planning permission. We were almost
ready to get started when the pandemic struck and our plans had to be put on hold.

The pandemic delayed our fundraising and made getting quotes for building work very difficult so we 
reorganised our planned updates.
