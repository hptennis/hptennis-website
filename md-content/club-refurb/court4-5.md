### May 2020 Renewal of Courts 4&5

We were having problems with the back of Courts 4 & 5, with cracking and moving so decided to get these courts refurbished first. 

Sovereign Sorts were our chosen contactors, they started in May 2020.

The culvert next to the club runs under courts 4 & 5, the courts are on clay and next to a huge oak tree. Probably some of the worst ground conditions for tennis courts to be built on.

When they lifted the old astroturf they were confronted with massive problems.

Fortunately for us Sovereign Sports were committed to doing the job properly and the necessary repairs were completed and new courts laid.

Thanks to Sovereign Sports for their hard work. Despite the pandemic progress is being made at Hampden Park Tennis Club.
