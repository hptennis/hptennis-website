# Covid Safety Rules. 
## From 12/04/2021

* Please obey government rules regarding safe travel to the site. E.G. arrive independently unless with family member.

* **If you show any signs of covid, do not come to the club.** 

* Arrive already changed, as showers, changing rooms out of use except for the toilets. Bring minimum equipment and your own drinks. Do not share any equipment except the tennis balls. Sanitise your hands after each set of games. 

* When entering the courts, allow those leaving plenty of space, before entering. Remember keep your distance.

* Always sign in for track and trace, either by using the book in the clubhouse, or using the NHS covid QR code. The club holds members details securely on the clubspark system so that we can notify people if there are any concerns regarding  a contact with someone who develops covid 19. 

* The clubhouse will be open to sign in for track and trace, access to first aid, the defibrillator and floodlights.

## **Members must not congregate in the clubhouse.**

* Toilets will be open for use. As access space is limited if the toilet is in use, please wait outside the building until it is safe to enter. After use please wipe down all handles, taps, toilet seat etc with the wipes provided and place in the pedal bin. Wash hands for at least 20 seconds and use paper towels provided. 

* Maintain distance when changing ends, no shaking hands at the end. 

* Please remember we are still under the rule of 6 for socialising off the court so do not stand around within the court area and chat.
